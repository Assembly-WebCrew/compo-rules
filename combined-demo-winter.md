Combined Demo Competition Rules

This competition celebrates creative real-time audiovisual demos. If you can code it and it runs on a publicly available platform, it belongs here.

Entries may target any generally available platform, including but not limited to:
- Modern Desktop platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- Retro/Oldskool platforms: C64, Amiga, Atari ST, NES, SNES, Mega Drive, Game Boy, etc.
- Fantasy consoles and virtual platforms: PICO-8, TIC-80, Picotron, Quadplay, Voxatron, IBNIZ, etc.
- Other accessible environments: WebGL, DOS, Java, or similar software environments.

If your entry requires custom or one-off hardware (FPGA, microcontroller, mechanical devices, etc.), please submit it to Real Wild instead.

- Demos may be up to 8 minutes long but organizers may choose to stop the production before the end.
- Entry must be in executable form â€” plain video playback or rendered animations are not allowed.
- The production must run in real-time.
- Size limited intros are welcome too. We will show the platform and size in the info slides.
- Zipped demo must be 2 GB max. Keep it reasonable on other platforms too.

Guidelines to follow if applicable to your platform
- The demo must be launchable using the normal method for the platform (e.g. EXE, cartridge, disk image, web player, etc.).
- The demo may not modify system settings permanently. Use temporary files only where applicable.
- The mouse cursor must be hidden during playback.
- The demo must allow exit at any time (e.g. ESC key, or standard quit method on other platforms).
- Windows intros: we recommend not using import by ordinal for DLLs with non-fixed ordinals to ensure better compatibility.

When submitting please provide:
- the executable and other files for running the demo
- you must provide a screenshot
- if your demo does not run on Windows 11 with NVIDIA then you MUST provide a video capture (1080p60 resolution preferred). Real hardware capture is preferred but emulator capture is okay too.
- Readme with instructions on running the demo etc.

Remote entries are welcome.
