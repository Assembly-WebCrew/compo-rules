# In-Game

These competitions are for content created inside games, e.g. in-game screenshots and videos recorded from a game.

- No 3rd party renderers allowed. This means that extracting game assets and rendering them outside the game they are from is not allowed.
- Modded games are allowed, but the mods must be publicly available and within the limits of good taste.
  - For example, Minecraft texture and shader packs are OK
  - K-18 content is NOT OK
- Game name must be mentioned in slidetext/techniques.

## In-game photo

- Show us your best landscape or most epic moment during your gaming adventures!
- The only supported image formats are PNG and JPG. Only RGB colour space allowed – no CMYK images.
- The image resolution must be 1920x1080 and must be submitted in supported file formats.
- Only minor retouching and adjustments are allowed, like crop, straighten, lens corrections, scaling, color temperature adjustment, exposure adjustment, desaturate.
- Do not add or remove elements from the picture.
- Composite photos are not allowed, meaning that the photo should be taken with a single exposure.
- Submit the photo without watermarks or signatures. If you make adjustments, submit the original version as a JPG or PNG (1920x1080 minimum if applicable). Original version and possible behind-the-scenes material will not be distributed.
- Picture must be previously unreleased.
- Since this is a photo competition, make art!
- Pictures will be shown in 1920x1080 resolution with full 24-bit color depth.
- Submit a version of the final image with NO visible signature. Name this file with a “_nosig” prefix (e.g. “cool_image.png” for the final image and “cool_image_nosig.png” for the unsigned version of the same image).
- You don't have to submit an image with a signature, only an unsigned version is necessary.
- A text file named "readme.txt" stating used techniques and sources of any material used in the entry must be submitted. If possible, we will tell the information about the techniques when showing the pictures on the big screen and when voting for them in the entry/votesystem.
- Once more: entries without a no-signature version will be disqualified.
- Ignoring any of these rules leads very easily to disqualification.

## In-game shortfilm

- Unleash your creativity and show us your best frag movie or tell a new story from within a video game.
- The production must be submitted in MP4 format with either H.264 or H.265 compression, with a preferred bitrate of 8000 kbps or more.
- The film may not last longer than 5 minutes.
- The majority of the footage used in the film must be from a video game.
- No copyrighted music is allowed, so no GMVs are allowed unless you have the necessary rights to the music and are able to provide proof alongside your submission.
- The film must be previously unreleased.
- Remote entries are allowed.
