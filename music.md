## General music rules

- There are no restrictions on composing techniques. Just make sure it's an original piece and in a supported format.
- All entries must be 100% original and unreleased. No covers, no remixes, no copyrighted material.
- If you are using Creative Commons or Public Domain material, state so in your entry form and cite the source! Do not forget to give credit where credit is due!
- Supported formats are 320kbps MP3, HQ OGG, WAV and FLAC
- A preselection jury will be held to comply with the time limit of each compo (typically 45 minutes). So do your best! If your entry is not shown, it will not be released by Assembly.
- It is up to you (not organisers) to submit to a suitable competition. Submitting to a wrong category (e.g. ambient music to the dance music competition) will simply result in a low jury score or disqualification.
. If you want to mention a specific platform in the song info (optional), it must be truthful. For example if you say this tune is a .sid, then it may not contain anything else besides the .sid (converted into the entry format).
- However, all entries may (and should) be normalised.
- Volume control (ReplayGain or similar) will be applied. Making the tune as loud as possible gives no advantage.

## Listening music

No restrictions! Make the track you have always wanted to do with the platform of your choice.
- See general music rules.
- Listening Music is considered to be music that is not suited to the dance music competition.
- Entry must be no longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds. Substantially exceeding this limit will result in disqualification (not fade-out)!

## Dance music

Turn the main hall into a party arena!
- See general music rules.
- Your tune must have a danceable beat and character, no restrictions otherwise.
- Entry must be no longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds. Substantially exceeding this limit will result in disqualification (not fade-out)!
- The competition may be presented as a DJ mix. Parts of your track may be crossfaded or mixed in with other compo tunes. The full track will still be released on for example scene.org.

## Fast music

Fast music started off when trackers were the tool to use and originally were a set of samples that the module was to be created with a strict time limit (generally 1 hour online, 1.5 hours at parties for that extra 30 min. for all the hassle). Since then we've spiced things up by removing the use of samples, forcing specific chord changes, limiting the genre to italo and making people sing "Assembly 25 years" into their headphones. What's in store for this year will be revealed at the party!
- See general music rules.
- Fast Music is created at the party with additional rules and restrictions that will be revealed 1.5 hours before the deadline.
- Entry must be no longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds (3:30).
- No software restrictions (usually).
- Submit the finished tune into the compo system before the competition deadline.
