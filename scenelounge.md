## Shader Showdown

Have you ever wanted to challenge your shader coding skills or code live visuals on stage and be like a rock star? In the showdown two coders battle each other in live coding. You’ve got 25 minutes to impress the audience with your mad coding skills, while a DJ spins records for your inspiration. Audience gets to see both shaders coming together live, parallel and then choose the winner.

Both competitors have same computer setup to use that is provided by the organizers. The live coding tool used in Shader Showdown is BONZOMATIC [https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic/releases](https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic/releases) (discussion here [https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=9881](https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=9881)). You can pick either GLSL or HLSL (DX9 or DX11) to compete with. Bringing your own keybord is more than welcome (just make sure it doesn't have memory function). No additional tools – such as paper, memory stick, radio, mobile phone, tablets, what so ever – are allowed.
