# AI Graphics

- The image must be fully generated by an AI tool via prompts without any post processing nor resizing.
- No starting image may be used - no white noise, no AI generated pictures, nothing. 
- No in- or out-painting on the image.
- You must submit clear evidence of the process of creating the image in the form of at least some versions (appropriate amount depending on the process and tool) of the unfinished picture that demonstrate the creation process. 
- Submit the final image in the format it comes from the AI tool, do not remove any metadata from the file.
- You must include the prompt, model, and the AI tool (e.g. Midjourney, Invoke AI).
- The image must be previously unpublished before the competition.
