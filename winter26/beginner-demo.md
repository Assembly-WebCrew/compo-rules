# Beginner Demo Competition
This competition is only for beginners. Remember that this competition is more about taking part, learning, and cheering for everyone than taking it too seriously!

[General rules](./general.md) and [Demo competition rules](./realtime.md) apply with the following addition:

The creator(s) must be beginners in demo making and must either:
 * Not have previously published any demos (procedural art) at demo parties. Groups must have a previously unused name to prevent name bias in voting ("namevoting"), **OR**
 * Have previously participated only in Assembly beginner competitions without receiving prizes.
