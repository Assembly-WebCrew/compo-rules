# Beginner Demo

Refer to the [General rules](./general.md) and [Combined Demo Competition](./combined-demo.md) with the following additions:

This competition is only for beginners. Remember that this competition is more about taking part, learning, and cheering for everyone than taking it too seriously!

The creator(s) must be beginners in demo making and must either:

* Not have previously published any demos (procedural art) at demo parties. Groups must have a previously unused name to prevent name bias in voting ("namevoting")

**Or:**

* Have previously participated only in Assembly beginner competitions without receiving prizes.

Remote entries are welcome.
