# Realtime

## General real-time competition rules

- Entry must be in an **executable form**. Pure animation files are not allowed in real-time competitions. Executables only including an animation and an animation player will not be accepted.
- Every competition has its own **maximum duration**, but organizers may choose to stop the production before the end.
- The production must work from **read-only media** and must not modify system settings (for example: Windows registry). However, you may use the platform's standard temporary directory during the execution of your entry for storing data, if such a service is available.
- The demo must show in a similar manner every time it is executed.
- Entries which cannot be run on the compo machines will be disqualified. To prevent this, you can ask us to test your production on the compo machines. Do this early and you will even have time to fix any problems that might arise.
- A **screenshot** image must be submitted with the entry to the competition management system.
- You must hide the **mouse cursor**.
- You do not have to be present at the party place to compete! **Remote entries are welcome!**
- Although not forbidden, we recommend not using import by ordinal for DLLs with non-fixed ordinals to ensure better compatibility.
- Entries will be recorded at 1080p60 (or possibly 1080p50) resolution.

## Demo

- Demo may not last longer than **8 minutes.**
- 2 GB size limit for the compressed archive.
- Entry must run on a **Desktop or Oldskool platform.**
- The user must be able to exit at any time by pressing a key. On PC, this key must be ESC.
- For Oldskool entries, see Oldskool compo rules.

## Oldskool demo combined

This is a combined demo competition for Oldskool hardware in the 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit era. The goal is to make a demo that runs on a legacy platform and shows or plays something interesting. Emulators or FPGA hardware can be used for development, but the end-product should work and be tested on real hardware. If your platform doesn't fit, consider submitting to the Real Wild compo. Feedback on the platform list is welcome with good arguments.

- Demo may not last longer than **8 minutes.**
- Demo must run on **Oldskool 8-bit & 16-bit** or **Oldskool 32-bit & 64-bit platform** (see below for details).
- Demo must be launchable using the standard procedure for that platform. If in doubt, ask us.
- No size limit, but it must be reasonable in the context of the platform.
- When submitting:
  - Specify the exact hardware configuration: machine type, PAL/NTSC, memory, required add-ons, SID model, etc.
  - Provide an internet-distributable version (e.g. disk image, CD-ROM image, or ZIP with executable and data files).
  - Provide a high-quality video capture. For example: 1920×1080 resolution at 60 Hz, using x264 in an MP4 container with a high bit rate. We may assist at the party place.
- Capturing the entry:
  - Preferably make your own high-bitrate capture.
  - Emulator or FPGA capture is discouraged and should be a last resort.
  - Ensure your entry works on real hardware.
- For questions, contact mattip on Discord, or email: <oldskool-contact@assembly.org>.

### Oldskool 8-bit & 16-bit platform

- Any oldskool home computer, console, or handheld with at most a 16-bit data bus.
  - Includes up to 4th-gen consoles and 5th-gen handhelds.
  - Examples: C64, Atari 2600, VIC-20, ZX Spectrum, Amiga 500, Atari ST(e), NES, SNES, Mega Drive, Game Boy Color, etc.
- Modern mass storage is allowed but must work from period-correct media where applicable.
- Vintage add-ons are allowed but must be clearly stated.
- Full FPGA systems are not allowed (submit to Real Wild). FPGA peripherals (e.g. Ultimate1541) are allowed.

### Oldskool 32-bit & 64-bit platform

- Any home computer, console, or handheld with a 32-bit or 64-bit CPU, with limits:
  - Amiga/PC must run on compo machines or equivalent.
  - Consoles: part of 5th-gen (e.g. PS1, Saturn, N64).
  - Handhelds: similar spec to others listed (e.g. GBA, N-Gage, DS).
  - Other platforms must be similar spec – ask for verification.
  - Examples: Pentium 133 MHz, Amiga AGA/060, Atari Falcon, PS1, Saturn, 3DO, N64, DS.
- Modern mass storage is allowed but must also run from period-correct media.
- Vintage CPU turbo cards are allowed and must be declared.
  - PC 3D accelerator cards are not allowed if they exceed compo spec.
- Full FPGA systems are not allowed. FPGA peripherals (e.g. PSIO flash cart) are OK.
