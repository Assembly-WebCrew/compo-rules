# Combined Demo

Refer to the [General rules](./general.md) with the following additions:

This competition celebrates creative real-time audiovisual demos. If you can code it and it runs on a publicly available platform, it belongs here.

Entries may target any generally available platform, including but not limited to:

- Modern Desktop platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- Retro/Oldskool platforms: C64, Amiga, Atari ST, NES, SNES, Mega Drive, Game Boy, etc.
- Fantasy consoles and virtual platforms: PICO-8, TIC-80, Picotron, Quadplay, Voxatron, IBNIZ, etc.
- Other accessible environments: WebGL, DOS, Java, or similar software environments.

If your entry requires custom or one-off hardware (FPGA, microcontroller, mechanical devices, etc.), please submit it to Wild (with AI) instead.

- Demos may be up to 8 minutes long but organizers may choose to stop the production before the end.
- Entry must be in executable form — plain video playback or rendered animations are not allowed.
- The production must run in real-time.
- Size limited intros are welcome too. We will show the platform and size in the info slides.
- Zipped demo must be 2 GB max. Keep it reasonable on other platforms too.

Guidelines to follow if applicable to your platform

- The demo must be launchable using the normal method for the platform (e.g. EXE, cartridge, disk image, web player, etc.).
- The demo may not modify system settings permanently. Use temporary files only where applicable.
- The mouse cursor must be hidden during playback.
- The demo must allow exit at any time (e.g. ESC key, or standard quit method on other platforms. However, with for example C64 this may not be possible or common, so you can ignore this for that kind of platform).
- Windows intros: we recommend not using import by ordinal for DLLs with non-fixed ordinals to ensure better compatibility.

When submitting please provide:

- the executable and other files for running the demo
- you must provide a screenshot
- if your demo does not run on Windows 11 with NVIDIA then you MUST provide a video capture (1080p60 resolution preferred). Real hardware capture is preferred but emulator capture is okay too.
- Readme with instructions on running the demo etc.

Remote entries are welcome.
