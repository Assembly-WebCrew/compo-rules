# Combined Music

## General music rules

- There are no restrictions on composing techniques. Just make sure it's an original piece and in a supported format.
- All entries must be 100% original and unreleased. No covers, no remixes, no copyrighted samples or other copyrighted material.
- If you are using Creative Commons or Public Domain material, state so in your entry form and cite the source! Do not forget to give credit where credit is due!
- Generative AI may not be used for significant portions of the song, such as entire vocal or instrument tracks.
- Supported formats are 320kbps MP3, HQ OGG, WAV, and FLAC.
- A preselection jury will be held to comply with the time limit of each compo (typically 45 minutes). So do your best! If your entry is not shown, it will not be released by Assembly.
- It is up to you (not organisers) to submit to a suitable competition. Submitting to the wrong category (e.g. ambient music to the dance music competition) will simply result in a low jury score or disqualification.
- Volume control (ReplayGain or similar) will be applied. It is recommended to normalise the volume of your entry, but making it as loud as possible by excessive compression gives no advantage in the competition.

## Listening music

No restrictions! Make the track you have always wanted to do with the platform of your choice.

- See general music rules.
- Listening Music is considered to be music that is not suited to the dance music competition.
- Entry must be no longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds. Substantially exceeding this limit will result in disqualification (not fade-out)!

## Dance music

Make people dance!

- See general music rules.
- Your tune must have a danceable beat and character, no restrictions otherwise.
- Entry must be no longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds. Substantially exceeding this limit will result in disqualification (not fade-out)!
- The dance music competition might be presented as a DJ mix, where parts of your track may be crossfaded or mixed in with other compo tunes. The full track will still be released afterwards.

## Fast music

Fast music competitions started off with trackers, and the entries were made with a strict time limit and the same set of samples for each contestant. Since then we've spiced things up by removing the use of samples, forcing specific chord changes, limiting the genre to italo and making people sing "Assembly 25 years" into their headphones, for example. What's in store for this year will be revealed at the party!

- See general music rules.
- Fast Music is created at the party with additional rules and restrictions that will be revealed 1.5 hours before the deadline.
- Entry must be no longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds (3:30).
- No software restrictions (usually).
- Submit the finished tune into the compo system before the competition deadline.
