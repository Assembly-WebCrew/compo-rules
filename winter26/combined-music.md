# Combined Music

## General music rules

- There are no restrictions on composing techniques. Just make sure it's an original piece and in a supported format.
- All entries must be 100% original and unreleased. No covers, no remixes, no copyrighted samples or other copyrighted material.
- If you are using Creative Commons or Public Domain material, state so in your entry form and cite the source! Do not forget to give credit where credit is due!
- Generative AI may not be used for significant portions of the song, such as entire vocal or instrument tracks.
- If generative AI is used, state in your entry form in which parts of the song and how AI is utilized.
- Supported formats are 320kbps MP3 and FLAC.
- A preselection jury will be held to comply with the time limit of the compo (typically 45 minutes). So do your best! If your entry is not shown, it will not be released by Assembly.
- Volume control (ReplayGain or similar) will be applied. It is recommended to normalise the volume of your entry, but making it as loud as possible by excessive compression gives no advantage in the competition.

## Music

No restrictions! Make the track you have always wanted to do with the platform of your choice.

- See general music rules.
- All platforms and techniques are allowed: modern DAWs, trackers, oldskool platforms (C64, Amiga, etc.), or anything else.
- Entries made on oldskool platforms or in tracker formats must be converted and submitted as MP3 or FLAC.
- Entry must be no longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds. Substantially exceeding this limit will result in disqualification (not fade-out)!
