## Real Wild

- Platform can be anything that can run **real-time graphics!** This includes any hardware (e.g. iPods, oscilloscopes, LCD displays) or software platforms/interpreters/emulators running on modern hardware.
- If your demo can be run on both real hardware and an emulator on PC, it is preferred to run it on real hardware. For avoidance of doubt, all real-time rendered graphics demos that don't fit in the demo competition or the Oldskool demo competition will fit here in terms of platform.
- The demo must be delivered in **both executable** (if possible) **and a video file** â€“ see the Short Film rules about allowed formats.
- If you don't have the necessary hardware to record the video on your own, contact the organizers to set up a recording session. Do this one week prior to the party. We will be glad to help!
- If you bring your entry to be recorded at the party place and the device/platform doesn't have an external audio output, the soundtrack of the entry must be delivered separately.
- Demo may not last longer than **5 minutes**.
- Hardware and/or components must have been previously released (no unreleased R&D hardware).
- You must provide specific instructions to build, configure, install, and run the entry on the platform. If the platform/device is your own specific hack, the **instructions** to do such a hardware hack must be included.
- To prove your entry really runs on the platform, you must either:
  - **bring the hardware to the party place** and show your demo to the organizers / the jury, or
  - **in case of remote entries**, record a proof video if the actual competition video does not provide enough proof. Organizers/jury will judge the proof. If in doubt, contact the organizers.
- Pure animation files are not allowed in real-time competitions. Executables that only include an animation and an animation player will not be accepted.
- Remote entries are allowed.

## Short Film

- The production must be submitted in a video format supported by VLC for Windows.
- The film may not last longer than **5 minutes**.
- Computer-generated pieces of art (e.g. animations, machinima, etc.) are preferred over plain home video types of entries. From now on, you can submit any videos of real-time generated graphics on odd devices to the Real Wild demo competition.
- Remote entries are allowed.
