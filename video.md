##Real Wild

- Platform can be anything that can run **real-time graphics!** You can have here any hardware (including iPods, oscilloscopes, LCD displays, basically anything that can produce real-time moving images) or software platforms/interpreters/emulators running on modern hardware.
- If your demo can be run on both real hardware and on an emulator on PC, of course it is preferred to run it in a real hardware. For avoidance of doubt, all real-time rendered graphics demos that don't fit in the demo competition or the oldskool demo competition will fit here in terms of the platform.
- The demo must be delivered in **both executable** (if possible) **and a video file** - see the file rules about allowed formats.
- If you don't have the necessary hardware to record the video on your own, contact the organizers to set up a recording session. Do this one week prior to the party. We will be glad to help!
- If you bring your entry to be recorded at the party place and the device/platform doesn't have an external audio output, the soundtrack of the entry must be delivered separately.
- Demo may not last longer than **5 minutes**.
- The **device/components/platform have to be publicly available** (or have been available in the past) for anyone to purchase.
- You must provide specific instructions to build, configure, install, and run the entry on the platform. If the platform/device is your own specific hack, the **instructions** to do such a hardware hack must be included.
- To prove your entry really runs on the platform, you must either:
	- **bring the hardware to the party place** and show your demo to the organizers / the jury, or
	- **in case of remote entries**, record a proof video if the actual competition video does not provide enough proof. Organizers/jury judge the proof. If in doubt, contact the organizers.
- Pure animation files are not allowed in real-time competitions. Also executables only including an animation and an animation player will not be accepted.
- The demo must show in a similar manner every time executed
- Remote entries are allowed

##Short-film

- The production must be submitted in a supported video format.
- The film may not last longer than 5 minutes
- Computer generated pieces of art (e.g. animations, machinima, ...) are preferred over plain home video types of entries. From now on, you can submit any videos of real-time generated graphics on odd devices to the Real Wild demo competition.
- Remote entries are allowed
