# One Scene Competition
"One scene" is only a name and a recommendation - you can have two or more scenes if they fit in the 1 minute running time. This competition is especially intended for newcomers but is open for everyone. Just remember that this competition is more about taking part, learning, and cheering for everyone than taking it too serious!

[General rules](./general.md) and [Demo competition rules](./realtime.md) apply with the following addition:

 * The scene will be shown for at most 1 minute. It may either loop over the same contents or finish at any time before the 1 minute maximum running time.
