## General format rules for the graphics compos

**READ THIS FIRST.** The following file format rules apply to all graphics competitions except for pixeled graphics.

- The only supported image formats are PNG and JPG. Only RGB colour space allowed - no CMYK images.
- If the original image was in vector format you may include the image in the submission package also in SVG format. However, the PNG or JPEG image will be the primary submission and will be shown on the big screen.
- Pictures will be shown in 1920x1080 resolution with full 24bit color depth.
- Submit a version of the final image with NO visible signature. Name this file with “_nosig”prefix (e.g. “cool_image.png” for the final image and “cool_image_nosig.png” for unsigned version of the same image).
- You don't have to submit an image with a signature, only an unsigned version is necessary.
- A text file named "readme.txt" stating used techniques and sources of any material used in the entry must be submitted. If possible, we will tell the information about the techniques when showing the pictures on the big screen and when voting for them in the entry/votesystem.
- Once more: entries without a no-signature version will be disqualified.

## Freestyle

- The image resolution must be 1920x1080 and must be submitted in supported file formats, see Graphics formats above.
- You must submit clear evidence of the process of creating the freestyle graphics competition picture in the form of at least SIX versions of the unfinished picture that show the creation process.
- This means that the different steps of the process (e.g. outline, coloring, retouching) are shown in different files from different points in time when the picture is being created
- If you are using a modeler, it is not sufficient to submit six pictures of the final picture from different view points! If you are using a photograph, take few extra shots and include them as a proof.
- The resolution of the unfinished pictures must be at least the same as the resolution of the final picture, but you can submit also higher resolution pictures.
- Order the unfinished stages of the picture by renaming the files with appropriate prefixes (f.i. “stage1.png”, “stage2.png”) and put them into a subdirectory called “unfinished” in the ZIP archive.
- You can use any technique you want to produce the picture: you can draw on paper and scan that picture, take a photograph and retouch it, use a 3D modeller tool, draw pixel by pixel or do what ever you want
- Write the techniques used in the PMS while submitting the image, maximum of 5 words (i.e. “Scanned photo + editing”, “3DS Max + light photoshopping”, “completely vector based”, “Composition of multiple methods”)
- You may also include the image in source or vector format in the submission package, if the size of the package does not exceed 10 MB
- While you are allowed to use stock photos in your entry, clearly the major part of the entry must be result of your own creativity. Use only stock photos you have the rights to.
- The AI tools of Adobe® Photoshop® or similar software in the Freestyle Graphics compo is prohibited.
- See also must-follow guidelines on Graphics formats.

## Pixel

This is an oldschool pixeled graphics competition. It means that we’re 
expecting to see entries that have been drawn pixel by pixel, by using old fashioned techniques and not for example overpainting renders, repainting or using photos as parts of the picture. If something in the picture seems to be out of place, it might not make it to be presented on the big screen.

- The image resolution must be 320x240 with 256 colors and the format must be GIF.
- Entries will be shown (proportionally scaled) on a 16:9 screen.
- GIF animation is not allowed.
- Picture must have not been released before.
- Using of stock photos, paintover, etc techniques is NOT ALLOWED in this competition.
- Submit one version of the final image with signature, one without signature and five (5) intermediate steps to show the process of pixeling the image. Name the files clearly.
- These rules override generic graphics competition rules. Entries without an unsigned final picture will be disqualified.
- The AI tools of Adobe® Photoshop® or similar software in the Pixel Graphics compo is prohibited.
- If you have questions or wish to have a clarification on the rules, please contact your friendly scene lounge organizers well before the competition! Happy pixeling <3

## Photo

The photo competition does not have a theme this time. Go do art!

- The image resolution must be 1920x1080 and must be submitted in supported file formats, see Graphics formats above.
- Only minor retouching and adjustments are allowed like
  - crop, straighten, lens corrections
  - scale
  - color temperature
  - exposure adjustment
  - desaturate
- Do not add or remove elements from the picture.
- Composite photos are not allowed, meaning that the photo should be taken with single exposure. This rules out photos taken using internal photo stacking and HDR, for example.
- Submit the photo without watermarks or signatures. If you make adjustments, submit the original version as a JPG or PNG (1920x1080 minimum if applicable). Original version and possible behind the scenes -material will not be distributed. If you have submitted a scan of a photograph or a slide, prepare to present the original media to the jury as well. In such case the original media will be returned through the Infodesk.
- Picture must be previously unreleased.
- Since this is a photo competition, make art!
- See also must-follow guidelines on Graphics formats. Please.
- Ignoring any of these rules leads very easily to a disqualification.

## Fast

- The image resolution must be 1920x1080 and must be submitted in supported file formats, see Graphics formats above.
- You have 1.5 hours time to complete your picture. Submit the finished picture by the competition deadline.
