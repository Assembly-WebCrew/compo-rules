# Wide Screen Competition
In Wide Screen competition the participants get to harness the ultimate opportunity of running their entries in a 5:1 ratio image (3840×768) taking advantage of the party screen area. Physical size of the display is 40 m × 8 m. In Wide Screen competition the allowed formats include real time, video and still images.

## Entry must meet all of the following:

**LENGTH:** The entry may not last longer than 8 minutes. Organizers may choose to stop the production before it finishes to play


**PLATFORM:** Entry must run on a desktop platform if it is a real time entry


**SIZE:** While there is no specified size limit, we still expect it to be reasonable (i.e. something that fits on an average USB stick). As long as you can deliver it to us either by uploading through the party system or on a physical medium


The video will be captured cropping a 5:1 ratio area of the generated visual. It will not be pixel perfect. The final effective resolution will be something around 3840×768.

* Entry must be executable on compo computer
* Entry must be a still image using resolution 3840×768
