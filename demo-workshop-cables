# Demo workshop - Cables

In the Cables competition the idea is to compete with a patch made in Cables.gl. You can participate to the compo by creating a patch at https://cables.gl and submitting its secret URL to the party system. This competition is intended for the attendees of the demo workshop. Just remember that this competition is more about taking part, learning, and cheering for everyone than taking it too seriously!

- The patch will be shown for at most 1 minute. It may either loop over the same contents or finish at any time before the 1 minute maximum running time.
- The patch will be shown fullscreen without user interaction.
- The patch must be under your account, and not published publicly before the showing of the compo.
- The entry needs to be submitted to the party system by the deadline.
- Check more detailed instructions for making submission from the “Demoscene Participate” -pages.
