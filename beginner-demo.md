# Beginner Demo Competition
This competition is only for beginners. Remember that this competition is more about taking part, learning, and cheering for everyone than taking it too seriously!

[General rules](./general.md) and [Demo competition rules](./realtime.md) apply with the following addition:

 * The creator(s) must be beginners in demo making, i.e., to not have published any demos (procedural art) at demo parties before this. Groups must have a previously unused name to prevent name bias in voting ("namevoting").
